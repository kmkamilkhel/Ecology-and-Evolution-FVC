# Ecology-and-Evolution-FVC
This repository contains the R scripts and data for analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) using machine learning models. The project integrates environmental predictors such as precipitation, temperature, and soil moisture to forecast vegetation dynamics across diverse landscapes.
